# Fluid-Dynamics-Project
Includes all I have done for the fluid dynamics project, even the references I have used

The Mathematica file was used for making the numerical calculations for the photon emission rates and thermal photon production rates, but the python file was used for making the plots out of the text files in which the results were compiled. There is one binary file that was needed for calculating the QCD equation of state with Bjorken.

The text files are the results from the numerical calculations using both methods of photon emission calculations, within the same range of momentum and with the same values of initial temperature and tau. The text files are split into Leading Log and Leading Order photon emission calculations (T=0.3GeV, 0.5GeV), Leading Log and Leading Order thermal photon production calculations (T=0.3GeV, 0.5GeV), and Bjorken Leading Log Conformal and QCD thermal photon production calculations (T=0.5GeV). 

The png files are the figures produced by the text files, with the Bjorken calculations compared with data from PHENIX at Teff~260GeV/c
