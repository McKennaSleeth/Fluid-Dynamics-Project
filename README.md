# Thermal Photon Production Project 
Includes all I have done for the project.

The Mathematica file was used for making the numerical calculations for the photon emission rates and thermal photon production rates, but the python file was used for making the plots out of the text files in which the results were compiled. There is one binary file that was needed for calculating the QCD equation of state with Bjorken.

The text files are the results from the numerical calculations using both methods of photon emission calculations, within the same range of momentum and with the same values of initial temperature and tau. The text files are split into Leading Log and Leading Order photon emission calculations (T=0.3GeV, 0.5GeV), Leading Log and Leading Order thermal photon production calculations (T=0.3GeV, 0.5GeV), and Bjorken Leading Log Conformal and QCD thermal photon production calculations (T=0.5GeV). 

The png files are the figures produced by the text files, with the Bjorken calculations compared with data from PHENIX at Teff~300 to 400 MeV/c. The data comes from Au-Au collisions at center of mass energy of 200 GeV, with collision centrality at 0-20% (mostly head-on). This was extracted from Figure 16 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17187.pdf from HEPData.
